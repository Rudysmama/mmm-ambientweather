Ambient Weather Station for Magic Mirror

Goal is to be able to see my personal data from my Ambient Weather Station in my Magic Mirror build.  

MagicMirror² is an open source modular smart mirror platform. With a growing list of installable modules, the MagicMirror² allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant. http://magicmirror.builders https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror
